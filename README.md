## Machine-Learning-Models-for-California-Housing-Price-Prediction
#### Developed Machine Learning Models to Forecast Fair Market Value for Houses in Californa State.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
#### Algorithms of Linear Regression (including Ridge and Lasso), Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost are implemented in this Notebook.
#### Random Forest max_depth ranged from 2 to 50.
#### Results show that XGBoost got best accuracy and R_sqaure.
